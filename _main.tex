% Template for USENIX papers.
%
% History:
%
% - TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%   USENIX '05. originally a template for producing IEEE-format
%   articles using LaTeX. written by Matthew Ward, CS Department,
%   Worcester Polytechnic Institute. adapted by David Beazley for his
%   excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings, Tcl 96. turned into a
%   smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to both the
%   above pioneers. Use at your own risk. Complaints to /dev/null.
%   Make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point.
%
% - Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to
%   separate the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that
%   people can more easily include the .sty file into an existing
%   document. Also changed to more closely follow the style guidelines
%   as represented by the Word sample file.
%
% - Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you
%   want foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the
%   usepackage command, below.
% - This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09
%   stuff.
%
% - Updated July 2018: Text block size changed from 6.5" to 7"
%
% - Updated Dec 2018 for ATC'19:
%
%   * Revised text to pass HotCRP's auto-formatting check, with
%     hotcrp.settings.submission_form.body_font_size=10pt, and
%     hotcrp.settings.submission_form.line_height=12pt
%
%   * Switched from \endnote-s to \footnote-s to match Usenix's policy.
%
%   * \section* => \begin{abstract} ... \end{abstract}
%
%   * Make template self-contained in terms of bibtex entires, to allow
%     this file to be compiled. (And changing refs style to 'plain'.)
%
%   * Make template self-contained in terms of figures, to
%     allow this file to be compiled. 
%
%   * Added packages for hyperref, embedding fonts, and improving
%     appearance.
%   
%   * Removed outdated text.

% Your abstract text goes here. Just a few facts. Whet our appetites.
% Not more than 200 words, if possible, and preferably closer to 150.
Phishing has been the top online attack nowadays.
Phishers implement cloaking techniques to evade detection from anti-phishing systems by checking profiles from HTTP requests in server side as well as from browsers in client side.
The anti-phishing ecosystem has been devoting to reveal real phishing content behind cloaks.
However, it has few progress because phishers can always enrich their fingerprinting database by adding new rules to distinguish traffics from the ecosystem and hence evade the visit.

According to the situation where cloaking techniques are widely implemented in phishing attacks and the goal of anti-phishing is to prevent Internet users to see phishing contents, we consider the security problem from a different perspective: instead of trying best to reveal phishing content, we can leverage the cloaking techniques in phishing to prevent users to see phishing content. In this work, we propose \emph{Spartacus}, a framework that disguise Internet users as anti-phishing crawlers to request web page content of a suspicious URL, while remain users' own profiles on visiting whitelisted websites.

\textcolor{blue}{Evaluation plan:}
We evaluated Spartacus from different aspects: (1) Effectiveness: we have two groups open reported phishing websites, one with normal browser, the other with ``Spartacused'' browser, for three months. We expect to show Group 1 saw way more phishing than Group 2.
(2) Efficiency: Two groups visit same amount of websites to test the latency of Spartacus.
Also we use Spartacus to visit legitimate websites to evaluate the impact (layout of the websites).
Then, we evaluate how difficult is to maintain our Spartacus system.
(3) adversarial mindset
(4) other fingerprints to get

% \section{Introduction}
% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

% A paragraph of text goes here. Lots of text. Plenty of interesting
% text. Text text text text text text text text text text text text text
% text text text text text text text text text text text text text text
% text text text text text text text text text text text text text text
% text text text text text text text.
% More fascinating text. Features galore, plethora of promises.

% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \section{Footnotes, Verbatim, and Citations}
% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

% Footnotes should be places after punctuation characters, without any
% spaces between said characters and footnotes, like so.%
% \footnote{Remember that USENIX format stopped using endnotes and is
%   now using regular footnotes.} And some embedded literal code may
% look as follows.

% \begin{verbatim}
% int main(int argc, char *argv[]) 
% {
%     return 0;
% }
% \end{verbatim}

% Now we're going to cite somebody. Watch for the cite tag. Here it
% comes. Arpachi-Dusseau and Arpachi-Dusseau co-authored an excellent OS
% book, which is also really funny~\cite{arpachiDusseau18:osbook}, and
% Waldspurger got into the SIGOPS hall-of-fame due to his seminal paper
% about resource management in the ESX hypervisor~\cite{waldspurger02}.

% The tilde character (\~{}) in the tex source means a non-breaking
% space. This way, your reference will always be attached to the word
% that preceded it, instead of going to the next line.

% And the 'cite' package sorts your citations by their numerical order
% of the corresponding references at the end of the paper, ridding you
% from the need to notice that, e.g, ``Waldspurger'' appears after
% ``Arpachi-Dusseau'' when sorting references
% alphabetically~\cite{waldspurger02,arpachiDusseau18:osbook}. 

% It'd be nice and thoughtful of you to include a suitable link in each
% and every bibtex entry that you use in your submission, to allow
% reviewers (and other readers) to easily get to the cited work, as is
% done in all entries found in the References section of this document.

% Now we're going take a look at Section~\ref{sec:figs}, but not before
% observing that refs to sections and citations and such are colored and
% clickable in the PDF because of the packages we've included.

% \section{Floating Figures and Lists}
% \label{sec:figs}
% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


% %---------------------------
% \begin{figure}
% \begin{center}
% \begin{tikzpicture}
%   \draw[thin,gray!40] (-2,-2) grid (2,2);
%   \draw[<->] (-2,0)--(2,0) node[right]{$x$};
%   \draw[<->] (0,-2)--(0,2) node[above]{$y$};
%   \draw[line width=2pt,blue,-stealth](0,0)--(1,1)
%         node[anchor=south west]{$\boldsymbol{u}$};
%   \draw[line width=2pt,red,-stealth](0,0)--(-1,-1)
%         node[anchor=north east]{$\boldsymbol{-u}$};
% \end{tikzpicture}
% \end{center}
% \caption{\label{fig:vectors} Text size inside figure should be as big as
%   caption's text. Text size inside figure should be as big as
%   caption's text. Text size inside figure should be as big as
%   caption's text. Text size inside figure should be as big as
%   caption's text. Text size inside figure should be as big as
%   caption's text. }
% \end{figure}
% %% %---------------------------


% Here's a typical reference to a floating figure:
% Figure~\ref{fig:vectors}. Floats should usually be placed where latex
% wants then. Figure\ref{fig:vectors} is centered, and has a caption
% that instructs you to make sure that the size of the text within the
% figures that you use is as big as (or bigger than) the size of the
% text in the caption of the figures. Please do. Really.

% In our case, we've explicitly drawn the figure inlined in latex, to
% allow this tex file to cleanly compile. But usually, your figures will
% reside in some file.pdf, and you'd include them in your document
% with, say, \textbackslash{}includegraphics.

% Lists are sometimes quite handy. If you want to itemize things, feel
% free:

% \begin{description}
  
% \item[fread] a function that reads from a \texttt{stream} into the
%   array \texttt{ptr} at most \texttt{nobj} objects of size
%   \texttt{size}, returning returns the number of objects read.

% \item[Fred] a person's name, e.g., there once was a dude named Fred
%   who separated usenix.sty from this file to allow for easy
%   inclusion.
% \end{description}

% \noindent
% The noindent at the start of this paragraph in its tex version makes
% it clear that it's a continuation of the preceding paragraph, as
% opposed to a new paragraph in its own right.


% \subsection{LaTeX-ing Your TeX File}
% %-----------------------------------

% People often use \texttt{pdflatex} these days for creating pdf-s from
% tex files via the shell. And \texttt{bibtex}, of course. Works for us.

% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \section*{Acknowledgments}
% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

% The USENIX latex style is old and very tired, which is why
% there's no \textbackslash{}acks command for you to use when
% acknowledging. Sorry.

% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \section*{Availability}
% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

% USENIX program committees give extra points to submissions that are
% backed by artifacts that are publicly available. If you made your code
% or data available, it's worth mentioning this fact in a dedicated
% section.
